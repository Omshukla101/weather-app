# Weather App

This project is a simple web application that fetches and displays weather data from a weather API, providing users with current weather information.

## Features

* **Real-time Weather Data:** Fetches and displays current weather conditions.
* **Location-Based Weather:** Allows users to search for weather by city name.
* **Dynamic Display:** Updates weather information dynamically based on user input.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a clean and easy-to-understand display of weather data.

## Files

* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the weather application.
* `style.css`: Styles the application using CSS.
* `weather.js`: Implements the weather data fetching and display logic using JavaScript.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Omshukla101/weather-app/new/main]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd [project directory]
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

4.  **Enter a city name in the search field and press enter or click the search button.**

* **Note:** This application requires a weather API key. You will need to obtain one from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and add it to the `weather.js` file.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (Vanilla ES6+)
* Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
